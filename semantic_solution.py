# ### Data Processing
# Making the data accessible for training. What one would normally start with in any machine learning pipeline is writing a dataset - a class that will fetch the training samples. Once you switch to using your own data, you would have to figure out how to fetch the data yourself. Luckily most of the functionality is already provided by PyTorch, but what you need to do is to write a class, that will actually supply the dataloader with training samples - a Dataset.
#
# Torch Dataset docs can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html?highlight=dataset#torch.utils.data.Dataset) and a totorial on how to use them can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html#dataset-class).
#
# The main idea: any Dataset class should implement two "magic" methods:
# 1) `__len__(self)`: this defines the behavior of the python builtin `len` function. i.e:
#     `len(dataset)` => number of elements in your dataset
# 2) `__getitem__(self, idx)`: this defines bracket indexing behavior of your class. i.e:
#     `dataset[idx]` => element of your dataset associated with `idx`
#
# For this exercise you will not have to do it yourself yet, but please carefully read through the provided class:

# As you can probably see, if you clicked enough times, some of the images are really huge! What happens if we load them into memory and run the model on them? We might run out of memory. That's why normally, when training networks on images or volumes one has to be really careful about the sizes. In practice, you would want to regulate their size. Additional reason for restraining the size is: if we want to train in batches (faster and more stable training), we need all the images in the batch to be of the same size. That is why we prefer to either resize or crop them.
#
# Here is a function (well, actually a class), that will apply a transformation 'random crop'. Notice that we apply it to images and masks simultaneously to make sure they correspond, despite the randomness.
#
# Why do we bother making a bulky class to handle the relatively simple task of loading images? We want to keep the code modular. We want to write one dataset object, and then we can try all the possible transforms with this one dataset. Similarly, we want to write one Randomcrop transform object, and then we can reuse it for any other image datasets we night have in the future.
#

# %% [markdown]
# PS: PyTorch already has quite a bunch of all possible data transforms, so if you need one, check [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html#transforms-on-pil-image-and-torch-tensor). The biggest problem with them is that they are clearly separated into transforms applied to PIL images (remember, we initially load the images as PIL.Image?) and torch.tensors (remember, we converted the images into tensors by calling transforms.ToTensor()?). This can be incredibly annoying if for some reason you might need to transorm your images to tensors before applying any other transforms or you don't want to use PIL library at all.

# Now we need to define the architecture of the model to use. We will use a [U-Net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/) that has proven to steadily outperform the other architectures in segmenting biological and medical images.

#
# The U-Net has an encoder-decoder structure:
#
# In the encoder pass, the input image is successively downsampled via max-pooling. In the decoder pass it is upsampled again via transposed convolutions.
#
# In addition, it has skip connections, that bridge the output from an encoder to the corresponding decoder.

# We will use the [Dice Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen%E2%80%93Dice_coefficient) to evaluate the network predictions.
# We can use it for validation if we interpret set $a$ as predictions and $b$ as labels. It is often used to evaluate segmentations with sparse foreground, because the denominator normalizes by the number of foreground pixels.
# The Dice Coefficient is closely related to Jaccard Index / Intersection over Union.

# Answer:
# 1) Score remains between (0,1) with 0 being the worst score and 1 being the best. This case essentially gives you the Dice Loss and can be a good alternative to cross entropy.
#
# 2) Scores will fall in the range of [-1,1]. Overly confident scores will be penalized i.e. if the target is `[0,1]` then a prediction of `[0,2]` will score lower than a prediction of `[0,3]`.

#
# 1. Modify and evaluate the following architecture variants of the U-Net:
#     * use [GroupNorm](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.GroupNorm) to normalize convolutional group inputs
#     * use more layers in your U-Net.
#
# 2. Use the Dice Coefficient as loss function. Before we only used it for validation, but it is differentiable and can thus also be used as loss. Compare to the results from exercise 2.
# Hint: The optimizer we use finds minima of the loss, but the minimal value for the Dice coefficient corresponds to a bad segmentation. How do we need to change the Dice Coefficient to use it as loss nonetheless?
#
# 3. Compare the results of these trainings to the first one. If any of the modifications you've implemented show better results, combine them (e.g. add both GroupNorm and one more layer) and run trainings again.
# What is the best result you could get?

    This layer will simply compute the dice coefficient and then negate

    the optimal loss. Since the optimal dice coefficient is 1, it is
    convenient to get 1 - dice_coefficient as our loss.

    You could leave off the offset and simply have -1 as your optimal loss.
